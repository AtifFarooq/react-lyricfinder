# react-lyricfinder
A single ReactJS web-app that uses the Musicxmatch API to display top 10 songs and provide lyrics of any song title that is entered in the search bar. Uses Bootstrap classes for UI elements. I'm removing my API key from the JS files, you will need to register your own account and put the key in the relevant places in the code.

The main page displays the current top 10 tracks in the US right now:

The user can enter the name of a song (or the song lyrics) in the search bar, and the application will update the page and display appropriate results accordingly. The user can then press on the 'View Lyrics' button to be taken to a different page that contains the lyrics, along with selected meta-data relevant to the track:

This project is based on Brad Traversy's example, and was done for educational purposes.
